TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks gtx3g_exdes_i/gtx3g_support_i/gtx3g_init_i/inst/gtx3g_i/gt0_gtx3g_i/gtxe2_i/TXOUTCLK and drpclk_in_i are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks gtx3g_exdes_i/gtx3g_support_i/gtx3g_init_i/inst/gtx3g_i/gt0_gtx3g_i/gtxe2_i/TXOUTCLK] -to [get_clocks drpclk_in_i]

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ *_txfsmresetdone_r*/CLR}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '10' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
