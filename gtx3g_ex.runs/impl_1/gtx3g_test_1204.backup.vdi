WARNING: [Place 30-143] Sub-optimal placement for an IBUFDS / GT component pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Resolution: Since the IBUFDS connects to the GT in intelligent pin mode, to ensure that jitter margins for the GT clock input are met, the GT must be placed in the same clock region as, or the clock region immediately above, or the clock region immediately below the IBUFDS.

INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
CRITICAL WARNING: [Place 30-143] Sub-optimal placement for an IBUFDS / GT component pair. Processing will continue as all instances of this rule have been LOCed.

	gtx3g_exdes_i/gtx3g_support_i/gt_usrclk_source/ibufds_instQ0_CLK1 (IBUFDS_GTE2.O) is locked to IBUFDS_GTE2_X0Y6
	gtx3g_exdes_i/gtx3g_support_i/common0_i/gtxe2_common_i (GTXE2_COMMON.GTREFCLK1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on GTXE2_COMMON_X0Y0
Resolution: Since the IBUFDS connects to the GT in intelligent pin mode, to ensure that jitter margins for the GT clock input are met, the GT must be placed in the same clock region as, or the clock region immediately above, or the clock region immediately below the IBUFDS. Please ensure that location constraints on the IBUFDS and/or the GT are in compliance with this rule.
