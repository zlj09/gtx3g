2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	sysclk_in_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to AK30
	sysclk_in_IBUF_BUFG_collapsed_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
2 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are gtx3g_exdes_i/rxresetdone_vio_i, gtx3g_exdes_i/soft_reset_vio_i.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
