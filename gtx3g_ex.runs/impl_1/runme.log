WARNING: [Place 30-143] Sub-optimal placement for an IBUFDS / GT component pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Resolution: Since the IBUFDS connects to the GT in intelligent pin mode, to ensure that jitter margins for the GT clock input are met, the GT must be placed in the same clock region as, or the clock region immediately above, or the clock region immediately below the IBUFDS. Please ensure that location constraints on the IBUFDS and/or the GT are in compliance with this rule.

Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
